# Sat

## The tiny but mighty WebAssembly edge compute server

![Sat logo](/img/logo-sat-wide.svg)

Sat is a WebAssembly-powered server designed to have the maximum performance and smallest possible footprint. Our [E2 Core](../e2-core/e2-core.md) project is a fully-fledged platform with support for running entire applications, whereas Sat takes the opposite approach: run a single Wasm module blazing fast!

Sat has no dependencies (it is statically compiled), and can run in a tiny Docker container (Distroless) or on bare metal. It is meant to live in small places such as edge compute environments.
