# About Suborbital Compute

Suborbital Compute is a platform that allows your users to write and deploy serverless extensions for your app so they can develop custom integrations, customizations, and workflows. Our WebAssembly-based compute core lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure that you're protected from malicious code.

Compute is now in public beta! We are excited for you to [give it a try](https://suborbital.network) and send us your feedback.

Compute gives you everything you need to run your users' functions in a secure sandbox and integrate them into your product in whatever way makes sense for you. This includes a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

Use of Suborbital Compute is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://suborbital.network/terms-of-service.pdf).
