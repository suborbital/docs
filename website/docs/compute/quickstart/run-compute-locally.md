# Run Compute locally

To run Compute locally, you'll use the Subo CLI and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com), both of which must be installed before continuing.

## Prepare your local environment

The Subo CLI will create some files on disk to set up your local deployment, so get started by creating a `suborbital` directory somewhere on your filesystem:

```bash
mkdir suborbital
cd suborbital
```

## Start Compute

Next, use Subo to start your local Compute Core instance:

```bash
subo compute deploy core --local
```

You may be asked to enter your Environment Token, and then Subo will use `docker-compose` to launch your Compute Core instance automatically. Compute runs in the background by default. You can use `docker-compose logs -f` to view the logs of the running containers. Run `docker-compose down` to terminate the containers.

## Run Compute
When you run Compute, it will wait for you to press enter to start a REPL where you can add or edit functions (see [Working with Functions](../website/docs/compute/write-functions.md))

Press enter to launch the local Compute REPL...


1. Create or edit a function

Choose an option: 1

To create or edit a function, enter its name (or FQFN): new-fn
```

This will allow you create functions and use the Compute editor locally while you work on integrating your application. Follow the instructions in the REPL to create your first function.
