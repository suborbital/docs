# Connect your application

Now that you have set up Compute and created your first function, use the Compute client libraries to start integrating functions into your application:

If your application is written in JavaScript or TypeScript in Node.js, use our [Node.js Library](./client-libraries/nodejs.md). 

If your application is written in Go, use our [Go Library](./client-libraries/golang.md). 
## API Reference
We also provide [reference documentation](https://suborbital-compute.readme.io/reference/api-reference) for each of the Compute APIs.
