# Function editor

The Compute code editor is available for you to embed in your application, 
so your users can build their functions quickly and easily:

![Compute editor containing a 'Hello' function](../../assets/editor-screen.png)

The editor is hosted at `https://editor.suborbital.network`, and uses URL parameters to configure its connection to your builder service.

You will host the Compute builder service in your cloud infrastructure with a configured DNS name. In order to use the editor, an HTTPS connection to the builder is required.

To launch the editor, you can either [embed the editor in a frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) within your own webpage, or launch it in a new tab.

## Editor token

To authenticate the editor for a specific user to edit their own functions, 
[Compute's Administrative API provides an API to create an `editor token` ](https://suborbital-compute.readme.io/reference/gettoken)
for a 
given function.

## Configuration

The editor is configured with URL parameters. Here's an example:

`https://editor.suborbital.network?builder=https://builder.acmeco.com&token=K78as0aslwi30l8h5lbF4lS7&ident=com.suborbital.customer&fn=add-record`

Let's break it down:

**Builder**: `?builder=https://builder.acmeco.com`

* This is the URL of your builder service

**Token**: `&token=K78as0aslwi30l8h5lbF4lS7`

* The editor token retrieved from the control-plane service

**Ident**: `&ident=com.suborbital.customer`

* The identifier used when addressing your specific user, see 
  [Fully-qualified function names](./fully-qualified-function-names.md) for 
  more details

**Fn**: `&fn=add-record`

* The specific function name that the editor should load

**Namespace** (optional): `&namespace=default`

* The function namespace (if not included, the `default` namespace is used, see [Namespaces](docs/compute/customizing-functions/namespaces.md) for more details)

**Template** (optional): `&template=assemblyscript`

* The language template used for new functions. Check out our [supported 
  languages](../../reactr/language-support.md)!

If the `fn` in question does not exist, the editor will automatically create a new function.

## Building and deploying

Once the user has edited their function, the `build` button in the top right 
will allow them to check to ensure the function builds. The builder service will build the function and then return the results to the console area.

Assuming the build succeeds, the user can choose to deploy the latest 
version with the `deploy` button. If they choose not to deploy, the draft will be available to them later.

Until the us√èer deploys the function, it will remain at the previous version. 
The [API Reference](https://suborbital-compute.readme.io/reference/api-reference) gives you details about the draft and active versions of any function.
