# Suborbital Function Platform

![Suborbital logo](/img/suborbital-logo-wide.svg)

The Suborbital Function Platform  allows your users to write and deploy 
functions and workflows that integrate into your app. Our WebAssembly-based 
platform lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure you're protected from malicious code.

Suborbital's Function Platform is now in public beta! We are excited for you to [give it a try](/get-started)
and send us your feedback. 

Suborbital's Function Platform gives you everything you need to run your users' functions in a secure sandbox and integrate them into your product in whatever way makes sense for you. This includes a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

Use of Suborbital's Function Platform is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://suborbital.network/terms-of-service.pdf).
