# Compute API Reference

You can find a detailed specification of Compute's APIs [here](https://suborbital-compute.readme.io/reference/api-reference).

## Administrative API

The Compute control plane exposes administrative APIs that are designed to help you and your users view, manage, and organize their functions. 

## Execution API

Your application servers will use the Execution API servers to **execute** 
the functions your users build.

## Builder API

The Compute builder service that you set up with Compute can 
automatically build WebAssembly modules for you. It exposes an API that can 
build **AssemblyScript and Rust functions.**
