# Quickstart

<!-- TODO: add "click this, then that" sort of scaffolding -->

<!-- TODO: intro bits, including explicit learning objectives like https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/-->

## Preliminary steps

- Create an account on our [admin dashboard](https://suborbital.network)
- Clone the repo for this demo <!-- TODO: add link -->

Let's go! üöÄ

## Create an organization

This is a new account, so we'll need to create our first organization. <!-- TODO: define this? --> For this demo, we'll give our organization:

- The name `Demo Company`
- The description `Always ready to demo`

<!-- TODO: add image -->

## Create an environment

We can set up multiple separate environments for each of our organizations. These could be used for separating production/development/staging environments,
or to create different applications for distinct use cases.

Let's set up our first environment for development! We'll give it:

- The name `demo.dev`
- The description `development environment`

Once we've created our environment, we'll be shown our environment's dashboard.
The dashboard contains information about various usage metrics related to the Extension Engine.

Here we can see a counter for function builds and build minutes. Both of these  currently 0 because we still need to set up our first integration.

## Create an access key

Next, we'll need to create an access key. We'll click on:

- Manage access keys
- Create new access key

Our integration will use this access key to provision resources and execute plugins in SE2. We'll give our access key:

- The name `DemoKey`
- The description: `demo access key`

We'll only be shown this access key once, so we'll need to store it somewhere safe and secure!

## Introducing PRO.xyz, our demo app

Now that we have our access key, we can move on to integrating SE2 with our application! For this, we've built a simple demo application.

PRO.xyz (prock-seez) is an imaginary company that operates networking services.
Its services can be used to load-balance & cache requests,as well as protect its customers' servers from network attacks.

Of course this is just a demonstration, so what happens behind the scenes is that our service generates a made-up "request log" of inbound HTTP requests
that are being forwarded to upstream hosts.PRO.xyz' clients are able to view these requests in their dashboard

Most providers have their own logic and algorithms that detect abuse,
send out alerts or initiate protective measures. They may allow for some customizability, but it's *usually* very limited.

PRO.xyz, on the other hand, has decided to make it possible *for its users* to fine-tune protections and alerts using the Suborbital Extension Engine. Suborbital's plugin system is used here to give users additional control and flexibility around deciding how requests are handled.

For this demo we'll just focus on tagging suspicious requests, helping the provider improve its protections.

## The part where the integration happens

<!-- Would be great if we could use this!

## API Admin interface

First we change the default environment to the one we set up:

[Change text field "Environment" to "demo.dev"]

We will also need the access token configured for this environment

[Copy access key from VSCode to "Environment Access Token" text field]

This access key will be embedded into the application,
it will allow the application to use the Suborbital API
to provision resources

The demo interface confirms the validity of these credentials,
so we can proceed to the next step

## Tenants

Suborbital lets an application's users create their own secure, sandboxed plugins, carefully isolated from the core of the system and one another.For this reason we will create a new tenant, which is a user account with its own plugins inside Suborbital. Our application will then connect the tenant with
one of its own internally maintained users.

[Type "ada" into the Tenant field]

Our environment name ("demo.dev")
and tenant name ("ada") together will form the Identifier,
think of this as a bucket
to hold all of a user's plugins separate from the others

=> Create tenant: demo.dev.ada

Should there be need of further namespacing a tenant's modules,
Suborbital provides a "namespace" feature
For now, we will just leave this on "default"

## Modules

Now that we have access to a tenant, we can use the API to manage modules,
that is, plugins (or extensions) written in a variety of languages,
and compiled to WebAssembly to be safely executed in your
-- or our -- infrastructure

The backend service can be configured to offer
any or all of the supported languages,
shown here

We can also list the existing modules here

=> List modules

...which is going to yield an empty list, as we *just* created this user.

For most Suborbital users,
this functionality will live in your application's administrative interface,
while the module management will most likely be
integrated into your users' dashboard.

So let's not linger,
and see how such a workflow looks like

-->
## Application user journey

The application architecture itself is nothing out of ordinary; it's a Node.js app communicating with a simple HTML frontend using Vue.js. Our backend, as mentioned, generates fake "ingest logs" of network requests, our WebAssembly plugins will receive this request metadata, and attempt to spot abuse.

We provide many prebuilt components to make all of this a little easier: the frontend integrates with the Suborbital Module Editor, while the backend uses the JS SDK to interface with the SE2 REST API and our hosted Edge Dataplane

So time to put ourselves in the shoes of Ada, a PRO.xyz customer who just received access to Suborbital extensions on PRO.xys' platform.

- We'll give our customer the name `Ada`
- And we can type whatever we like for this pretend password
- Click "Sign in"

After logging in, we see the network requests as they are received by PRO.xyz' servers, and eventually forwarded to our upstream servers. When we pause the logs by clicking the "pause" button, though, we notice something peculiar...

There have been some requests to `wp-login.php`. Well, little wonder these were always met with a 404 Not Found response! Ada's servers run PHP indeed, but none of them are Wordpress sites! Clearly, someone is trying to find Wordpress vulnerabilities or exploit weak passwords for Wordpress sites on the internet,and they also ended up probing Ada's sites. To say this was "suspicious" would be a gross understatement.

Normally there wouldn't be much Ada could do about this, but thanks to the custom plugins we may actually turn this ship around.

## Build a module

Suborbital allows users to write custom plugins in their preferred language by clicking the "Language select" button, but unfortunately PHP is not on the list of supported languages‚Äîyet!‚Äîso Ada chooses JavaScript, another language she's quite comfortable with.

Clicking on the button that looks like three planes stacked vertically with a "+" next to them <!-- TODO: give this button an ID!-->, Ada opens up the Suborbital Module Editor that presents her with an interface for writing, compiling and deploying plugins.

PRO.xyz' integration only supports deploying one plugin per user. This is all up to the application, who may choose to allow their users build, deploy and use any number of plugins in any language, the sky is the limit.

The editor already comes preloaded with a generic JavaScript template, but we have Ada's module to use instead.

At the very baseline of it a plugin receives some input, processes that input,and may produce some output. Suborbital allows extra API's (sort of superpowers) to be exposed to these modules at the operator's discretion.

Here we are including the "log" API to have our application log any unexpected issues with the input data

We'll replace the default code in the editor with Ada's code below:

```js
import { log } from "@suborbital/runnable";

export const run = (input) => {
  const tags = [];
  try {
    let data = JSON.parse(input);

    // We don't operate Wordpress sites so this is immediately sus
    if (data?.uri?.includes("wp-login.php")) {
      tags.push("kinda-sus");
    }

    return JSON.stringify(tags);
  } catch (e) {
    log.error("Failed parsin incoming log data as JSON");
  }
};
```

Then I'm going to hit build and have our JavaScript source code compiled to a deployable WebAssembly module.

## Test

Great, that's done, we get to test it to see if it does what we expect!

We have a text field for specifying the "input" of this test run, I have a sample input prepared here that requests the Wordpress login page, and so it should trigger our module's spidey-senses.

We'll paste the text below into the "Test" field:

```text
{
   "id": "l9rkryfrn7",
   "request_start": "2022-10-27T20:21:36.538Z",
   "request_time": 0.1659020390745758,
   "remote_addr": "206.80.131.46",
   "remote_asn": "AS54113 FASTLY",
   "remote_cc": "FI",
   "request_length": 2252,
   "host": "noisy-cheeto.xyz",
   "method": "DELETE",
   "status": 200,
   "uri": "/wp-login.php",
   "upstream_host": "www0",
   "user_agent": "GoobleBot 1.0 (crawler)",
   "content_type": "text/html",
   "tags": []
}
```

And click "Run test". Sure enough, the output shown in the "output" field is: `kinda sus`! Our module returns an array of string "tags", which PRO.xyz will use to annotate the requests. Perhaps in this case, PRO.xyz (TODO: should this be Ada?) could use them to fine-tune its algorithms or abuse-mitigation strategies.

## Deploy

Alright, let's get this deployed by clicking:

- "Deploy"
- "Done"

And now we can head back to our dashboard. When I deployed our plugin, PRO.xyz was notified of this new custom integration for Ada, and will execute the WebAssembly module for all requests to make sure requests are properly tagged and its mitigation strategies tuned.

*kinda-sus pops up in one of the rows in the log* (TODO: how can we make this joke accessible?)

There we go, we got our first internet troublemaker exposed! 

Now we've seen how Suborbital Extension Engine can give application owners a way to let their users write their own plugins without compromising speed or security, and without the app owners needing to lift a finger!

## What else can I do?

Now that you've know how to get SE2 extensibility powers into your app, you might want to:

- [Learn more about SE2's API's](./how-to/using-api.md)
- Make custom [module templates](./how-to/customize-functions/custom-function-templates.md) and [libraries](./how-to/customize-functions/custom-libraries.md) to help your users get started building their own plugins for your app
- Organize your users' plugins into [namespaces](./how-to/customize-functions/namespaces.md) for different use cases
