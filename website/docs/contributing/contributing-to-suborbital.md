# Contributing to Suborbital

## Your very first contribution

### Find something to work on

The very first step towards contributing to Suborbital
is to find something to work on. No contribution is
small and help is always required!

Here are some great avenues to help you get going
on your contribution journey

- Help improve the documentation for various Suborbital projects
- Help triage issues

### Find a good first issue

There are multiple repositories within the Suborbital
organization. Each repository has issues that are 
beginner-friendly and can be accessed by filtering with
the label good-first-issues.

### Filing an issue

If you're not yet ready to start contributing code, but notice
something that requires work please report it against the 
appropriate repository. For example, any documentation-related
issue needs to be filed against the suborbital/docs repository.
