# Introduction

<img src="/img/hero.svg" width="300" height="300" alt="Suborbital logo"/>

Suborbital Extension Engine (SE2) is a platform that gives you everything you need to allow your users to write and deploy plugins that integrate into your app. Our WebAssembly-based runtime lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure you're protected from malicious code. SE2 comes batteries-included, providing a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

## Let's get you started!

In these docs you can:

- Use our [example app](quickstart.md) to get up and running in no time
- Check out how SE2 will help you provide a bespoke experience to your users with custom [plugin templates](./how-to/customize-functions/custom-function-templates.md) and [libraries](./how-to/customize-functions/custom-libraries.md)â€”without you having to become a feature factory!
- Learn how to [self-host SE2](./how-to/self-host-se2/integrate-your-app.md) in your app if that better suits your use case

## Getting Support

If you have any questions you can't find answers for on this site, please hit us up on [Discord](https://chat.suborbital.dev)!

SE2 is now in public beta! We're excited for you to [give it a try](./quickstart.md) and send us your feedback. Use of SE2 is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://suborbital.network/terms-of-service.pdf).
