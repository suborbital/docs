# Introduction

<img src="/img/hero.svg" width="300" height="300" alt="Suborbital logo"/>

Suborbital Extension Engine (SE2) is a platform that gives you everything you need to allow your users to write and deploy plugins that integrate into your app. Our WebAssembly-based runtime lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure you're protected from malicious code. SE2 comes batteries-included, providing a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

## Let's get you started!

In these docs you can learn how to:

- [Quickly get up and running with SE2](./quickstart.md)
- Use SE2 to provide a bespoke experience to your users with custom [plugin templates](./how-to/customize-plugins/custom-plugin-templates.md) and [libraries](./how-to/customize-plugins/custom-libraries.md)â€”without your having to become a feature factory!
- Use SE2's APIs from either [Go](./how-to/se2-go.md) or [JavaScript/TypeScript](./how-to/se2-js.md)
- Configure [capabilities](./how-to/deploy/cloud-deployment/configure-capabilities.md), [storage](./how-to/deploy/cloud-deployment/configure-storage.md), and [webhooks](./how-to/deploy/cloud-deployment/configure-webhooks.md) for SE2
- [Install SE2 in your cloud environment](./how-to/deploy/cloud-deployment/install-se2-in-your-cloud-environment.md)
- Or [deploy SE2 with minikube](./how-to/deploy/other-deployments/minikube.md)
