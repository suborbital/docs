# Suborbital Extensibility Engine (SE2)

![Suborbital logo](/img/suborbital-logo-wide.svg)

Suborbital Extensibility Engine (SE2) is a platform that allows your users to write and deploy 
functions and workflows that integrate into your app. Our WebAssembly-based 
compute core lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure you're protected from malicious code.

SE2 is now in public beta! We are excited for you to [give it a try](get-started)
and send us your feedback. 

SE2 gives you everything you need to run your users' functions in a secure sandbox and integrate them into your product in whatever way makes sense for you. This includes a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

Use of SE2 is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://suborbital.network/terms-of-service.pdf).
