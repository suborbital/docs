# Suborbital Extension Engine (SE2)

<img src="/img/hero.svg" width="300" height="300" alt="Suborbital logo"/>

Suborbital Extension Engine (SE2) is a platform that gives you everything you need to allow your users to write and deploy plugins that integrate into your app. Our WebAssembly-based runtime lets you run user code within your infrastructure while being sure you're protected from malicious code. SE2 comes batteries-included, providing a code editor, builder service, and an easy-to-use API.

## Prerequisites

MacOS or Linux, Go or JS/TS for sure, but are there other requirements? Can any app drop SE2 in?

## Getting Support

If you have any questions you can't find answers for on this site, please hit us up on [Discord](https://chat.suborbital.dev)!

SE2 is now in public beta! We are excited for you to [give it a try](./get-started.md) and send us your feedback. Use of SE2 is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://suborbital.network/terms-of-service.pdf).
