# Building and Running

The `subo` command line tool is used again here to build and run your Atmo project.

## Building

Inside the `important-api` directory run:

```text
subo build .
```

This automatically compiles each of your Runnables in a Docker container and bundles
them together in `runnables.wasm.zip` to be used in Atmo.

```text
‚è© START: building runnables in .
‚ÑπÔ∏è  üê≥ using Docker toolchain
‚è© START: building runnable: helloworld (rust)
    Updating crates.io index
[...]

‚úÖ DONE: bundle was created -> runnables.wasm.zip @ v0.1.0
```

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can also [build your Runnables natively](https://github.com/suborbital/subo/blob/main/docs/get-started.md#building-without-docker).

## Running a development server

Now that we have our application bundle built, we can start a development server. 

In the `important-api` directory, run:

```text
subo dev
```

This creates a Docker container running Atmo, copies your `runnables.wasm.zip` into
the container, and starts an Atmo server listening on `http://localhost:8080`.

You can test the `/hello` route in a second terminal by sending a POST request 
with a body to it:

```text
curl localhost:8080/hello -d 'from the K√°rm√°n line!'
```

Atmo runs and responds successfuly if you get a 200 OK response with the request body replayed to you in the response.
